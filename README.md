Hidden Markov Models for SNP Genetic Sequence Analysis
# Hidden Markov Models for Genetic Sequence Analysis

## Overview
This project implements a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to analyze genetic sequences,
with the goal of identifying hidden biological states from observed nucleotide data.

The project was developed independently as a computational modeling exercise,
focusing on probabilistic inference and biological interpretation.

## Methods
- Definition of hidden states and emission probabilities
- Implementation of forward-backward and Viterbi algorithms
- Parameter estimation using MATLAB built-in functions
- Validation using simulated and example genetic sequences

## Tools
- MATLAB
- Probabilistic modeling
- Genetics / bioinformatics concepts
